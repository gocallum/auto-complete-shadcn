# CV Management Application

## Overview

The **CV Management Application** is a web-based tool designed to help users manage their Curriculum Vitae (CVs) effectively. The application allows users to create, update, and maintain multiple CVs, tailored to different roles and companies they are applying for. The application leverages modern web technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, and React, with UI components from Shadcn and `react-select` for enhanced user interaction.

## Features

### 1. **Create and Manage CVs**
   - Users can create multiple CVs, each uniquely named to distinguish between different versions tailored for different job applications.
   - Each CV can be associated with a specific role and company, making it easier to manage applications for various job positions.

### 2. **Role and Company Selection with Auto-Complete**
   - The application features an auto-complete functionality for selecting job roles and companies.
   - As users type in the role or company field, the application suggests options based on the input.
   - If the desired role or company is not listed, users can add new entries directly from the form, which will then be available for future use.

### 3. **Customizable Options**
   - The application allows users to add new roles or companies if they are not found in the predefined list.
   - These new entries are then stored and made available for subsequent use, enhancing the flexibility of the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for server-rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that provides static type-checking.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Shadcn**: A component library providing pre-designed UI components.
- **react-select**: A flexible, beautiful Select Input control for React with support for auto-complete and asynchronous loading.
